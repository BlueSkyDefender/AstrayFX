### Highlighted Shaders for ReShade 
**Smart Sharp**<br />
A Smart Bilateral Sharpening filer that uses depth to gradually phase out it's effect to keep very distant objects from becoming sharp.
Because who wants razor-sharp clouds? Birds don't, so why should you.

**Depth Cues**<br />
Depth Based Unsharp Mask intentional haloing. This will work with or without depth. On video, video games, and with still images.
This will enhance Depth Effects that are already apart of the scene. *UPDATE PENDING*

**Temporal AA**<br />
TAA is a Epic Games implementation of Temporal AA that seems the only real way of doing this in reshade with out motion vectors.

**Trails**<br />
This is an echoing based shader to add a trail to your image as you increase the image persistence. Mainly used for light painting.

**DLAA**<br />
A reworked port of Directionally Localized Antialiasing Light. Fun simple AA shader that can help with them jaggies .

**NFAA**<br />
A modded port of Normal Filter Anti Aliasing. With an interesting use case. Use this to assist SMAA or FXAA to catch all of them jaggies without blurring the screen.

**Blooming HDR**<br />
A Basic High Bloom mid Perf HDR shader that allows for automatic functions to help setting it up in-game.

**RadiantGI**<br />
RadiantGI is an indirect lighting algorithm based on the disk-to-disk radiance transfer. It's simply Radiant................
NOW WITH THE ADDED FEATURE TO NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC HOTKEY :) How neat!

**GloomAO**<br />
GloomAO is a Screen Space Directional Occlusion based shader that has TAA and basic GI built in.

And many more in the works.

### Shader Assistant
**Overwatch.fxh**<br />
Overwatch will assist many of my shaders by setting the Depth Settings for you in select games. To be honest this is the reason donations help me, help you. With every donation this allows Overwatch to grow. This makes it easier to just load it alongside my Depth
Based Shaders and have some settings set for you. Less Hassle more FUN.

### Game Compatibility
**Game Compatibility Information**

http://reshade.me/compatibility
At this link look for Depth Map Compatibility.
